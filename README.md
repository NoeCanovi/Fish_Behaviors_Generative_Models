# The code and dataset for the paper: Trajectory-based fish event classification through pre-training with diffusion models

## Highlights
- **Enhancing Fish Event Recognition:** We enhance the field of automatic fish event recognition in natural underwater videos, addressing the current gap in understanding fish interaction and competition, including predator-prey relationships and behaviors during mating seasons, particularly for male corkwing wrasse.

- **Novel Deep Learning Approach:** Our study makes a pioneering contribution to ecological informatics by introducing a novel deep learning approach to analyzing fish trajectories for behavior classification. This method utilizes unsupervised pre-training based on diffusion models to enhance feature learning.

- **Introducing a New Dataset:** We introduce a dataset of 16,937 trajectories across 12 event classes, benchmarked with several methods, confirming the superior performance of the proposed approach.

## Project Structure

- **Data_cleaning Folder:** Contains the processes performed on the original datasets, not on the individual trajectories, whose lengths are fixed.
- **Models Folder:** Includes the `Autoencoder` and `Diffusion Model` Jupyter Notebook files.
  - The `Autoencoder` should work independently.
  - The `Diffusion Model` requires files from the `video_anomaly_diffusion-main` folder, which is a slightly modified version of [video_anomaly_diffusion](https://github.com/AnilOsmanTur/video_anomaly_diffusion).

**Note:** Paths need to be updated, as well as `wandb` project and entity names.
