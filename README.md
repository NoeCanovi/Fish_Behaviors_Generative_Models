# Classifying Fish Behaviors through Trajectory-Based Generative Model Pretraining

This repository includes the code used in a master thesis regarding classifying Corwing Wrasse's behaviors with Autoencoder and Diffusion Model pretraining, plus a MLP for classification.

Data_cleaning folder includes the processes done on the original datasets.

Models folder include Autoencoder and Diffusion Model ipynb files. Autoencoer should work on its own. Diffusion Model requires files from video_anomaly_diffusion-main folder, a slightly modified version of [video_anomaly_diffusion](https://github.com/AnilOsmanTur/video_anomaly_diffusion/tree/main).
